# SaveUp
Real time budget tracking application. 

You can now keep track of all the income and expenditure. Along with adding your expense take a picture of the receipt if you have one and save it to the database. This way you you dont have to keep a physical copy all the time and its available for you when you need it. 

Plan a budget and the app will tell you when you have reached the limit.
